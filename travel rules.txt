=== Travel Rules

Treat EWR as airport for NYC

Estimating time need to consider time zone

If departure time is missing, estimate based on arrival time based on transportation mode

If both departure time and arrival time are missing, estimate by common travel schedule between the 2 locations based on the transportation mode

For flight travel, add 3 hours before departure time for travel start time and 2 hours after arrival for travel end time

Same departure and destination means not traveling

Assign location at every stop for > 2 leg trips

Potential work day time is reduced on travel days from 10am to 4pm

Work travel on a workday
	If either departure or destination location which can be classified as NYS workday on this day and have time to work outside travel time, then count as NYS workday. Otherwise, count as non-NYS workday.
