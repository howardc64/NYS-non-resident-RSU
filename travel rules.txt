=== Travel Rules

Treat EWR as airport for NYC

Estimating time need to consider time zone

If departure time is missing, estimate based on arrival time based on transportation mode

If both departure time and arrival time are missing, estimate by common travel schedule between the 2 locations based on the transportation mode

If > 1 trips on the same day don't have both departure and arrival time, warn user this is ambiguous to determine the order of travel

For flight travel, travel schedule starts 3 hours before departure time for travel start time and end 2 hours after arrival.

A trip leg with same departure and destination means not traveling

Assign location at every stop for > 2 leg trips

On travel day, reduce workday schedule from 10am to 4pm at both departure and destination location.
